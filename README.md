NLP app done with the Tec1, MINT and Speech chip.   

In 1966, program ELIZA was developed, which aimed at tricking it users by making them believe that they were having a conversation with a real human being. ELIZA was designed to imitate a therapist who would ask open-ended questions and even respond with follow-ups. It responds to questions with answers that sound like they were provided by a therapist. The program is designed to mimic human conversation, and it is often used to gull people into thinking they are talking to a real person. HAT DOES ELIZA DO? Using "'pattern matching" and substitution methodology, the program gives canned responses that made early users feel they were talking to someone who understood their input. The program was limited by the scripts that were in the program. (ELIZA was originally written in MAD-Slip.)

## Poor manâ€™s GPT-3: Few shot text generation with T5 Transformer
[3.] This website provides a simple way to generate text using the T5 transformer. You simply provide a prompt, and the transformer will generate text based on the prompt. The text generation is based on the T5 transformer, which is a neural network model that is trained on a large amount of text data. The transformer learn the relationships between the words in the text data, and can then generate new text that is similar to the training data.

### T5 transformer
The T5 transformer is a neural network model that is trained on a large amount of text data. The transformer learn the relationships between the words in the text data, and can then generate new text that is similar to the training data.and can generate text on its own.it can also improve the quality of the text it generates by fine-tuning the model on specific domains or tasks and can generate text in multiple languages and multiple genres, that is both grammatically correct and fluent.
