In 1966, program ELIZA was developed, which aimed at tricking it users by making them believe that they were having a conversation with a real human being. ELIZA was designed to imitate a therapist who would ask open-ended questions and even respond with follow-ups. It responds to questions with answers that sound like they were provided by a therapist. The program is designed to mimic human conversation, and it is often used to gull people into thinking they are talking to a real person. HAT DOES ELIZA DO? Using "'pattern matching" and substitution methodology, the program gives canned responses that made early users feel they were talking to someone who understood their input. The program was limited by the scripts that were in the program. (ELIZA was originally written in MAD-Slip.)
